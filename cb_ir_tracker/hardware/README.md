## hardware used for `cb_ir_tracker`

As infrared camera for this device i used a [160° (Fisheye) – Night vision camera module from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/night-vision-camera-module-for-raspberry-pi?variant=12516582817875). You can use it with the included led or probably with more powerful external ligths, for more info go to [my notes on infrared lights](https://github.com/npisanti/ofxClayblocks/tree/master/cb_ir_tracker/infrared).

The webcam is sold without a visible light filter, so i had to build one by cutting two congo blue gels and one primary ( search for "colored gel filters" ). You have to unscrew the camera, put the gels inside and then rescrew it:

I learned about the gels combination [thanks to this article](https://softsolder.com/2009/03/27/quick-and-easy-ir-passing-visible-blocking-optical-filter/).
